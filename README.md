An incomplete attempt at making some kind of markup language for news reporters to keep track of events, the people involved in said events, and the evidence.

## Purpose
I wanted to try and create some standardized format for new reporting sites, lawyers, or really, anyone who is contributing to or debating the veracity of an account of events. The format would enforce every claim be backed by evidence, and distil every reported event into:
- Actors
- Action
- Evidence

Now that I look back, the implementation of this was terrible. It's so hard to read that it would probably need to be machine generated, with a better user-facing interface (especially if it's a wide audience of non-programmers who's supposed to benefit from this).

However, I do think the core premise has promise, and am continuing to pursue this in other forms.
